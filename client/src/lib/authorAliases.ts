/**
 * Author Name Normalization
 *
 * Maps every known name variant → one canonical display name.
 * Rules:
 *   1. Canonical name = the most widely recognised form (full name, no middle initials unless
 *      needed to disambiguate, ampersand "&" for co-authors).
 *   2. Variants include: Drive folder suffixes, initials, alternate spellings, co-author order.
 *   3. Photo and bio lookups MUST call `canonicalName(raw)` before hitting their maps.
 *
 * To add a new alias: append an entry to AUTHOR_ALIASES.
 * To rename a canonical: change the value AND the AUTHOR_PHOTOS / authorBios.json key together.
