- [x] Leaderboard: Books Count metric tab
- [x] Leaderboard: Tag Count metric tab
- [x] Compare Authors page
- [x] Interest Heatmap page
- [x] Group Contrast page

---

## Content Items & Enrichment

- [x] `content_items` table in schema (title, type, url, coverImageUrl, s3CoverUrl, rating, etc.)
- [x] `contentItems` tRPC router — list, getByType, counts, create, update, delete, uploadCoverImage
- [x] YouTube enrichment procedure (`enrichFromYouTube` via YouTube Data API v3)
- [x] Podcast enrichment procedure (`enrichFromPodcast` via iTunes Search API)
- [x] `BulkUrlImportPanel` in Admin → Content Items tab (paste URLs → auto-import)
- [x] TED talk enrichment (view counts, event data via TED public API + OG tag fallback)
- [x] Academic paper enrichment (DOI, citations via OpenAlex API — free, no key required)
- [x] Film/TV enrichment (IMDB data via OMDB API — requires OMDB_API_KEY secret)
- [x] Substack post enrichment (individual post stats via Substack public API + OG fallback)
- [x] Support multi-author content items (many-to-many via `authorContentLinks` — schema + router + BulkUrlImportPanel author field)
- [x] Migrate existing `book_profiles` rows into `content_items` (idempotent batch migration with dry-run + progress UI in Admin → Content Items)
- [x] Seed sample non-book content items (19 items: 8 TED talks, 4 podcasts, 3 papers, 2 articles, 2 YouTube videos) for top authors (Adam Grant, Simon Sinek, Carol Dweck, Dan Pink, Amy Cuddy, Shawn Achor, James Clear, Tim Ferriss, Shane Parrish, Daniel Kahneman, Charles Duhigg)

---

## Admin Console

- [x] Admin Console with tabs: Authors, Books, Tags, Pipeline, Sync, Media, AI Models, Digital Me, Content Items
- [x] `AdminPipelineTab` — Run All cascade button (4-step: Regen DB → Enrich Bios → Enrich Books → Discover Platforms)
- [x] `SyncJobsTab` — Sync Manager with trigger, job history, cancel, credential status
- [x] `TagManagement` + `TagTaxonomyMatrix` + `BulkTagAssignment` in Admin → Tags
- [x] `TagStatisticsCard` bar chart in Admin → Tags
- [x] `MediaItemFormDialog` — Create / Edit / Delete in Admin → Content Items
- [x] `BulkUrlImportPanel` in Admin → Content Items
- [x] Admin sidebar badge counts and running indicators (e.g. jobs in progress)
- [x] Admin sidebar search/filter bar
- [x] Split `Admin.tsx` (643L → 447L) into 15 focused wrapper tab components under `components/admin/` — Admin.tsx is now a thin orchestrator shell with single-component calls per section

---

## Sync / Storage

- [x] `SyncJobsTab` — Dropbox sync trigger, job history, credential status
- [x] Stream-based S3 → Dropbox transfer: `syncEngine.ts` uses Dropbox Upload Session API (chunked, 50MB chunks) for audio files; simple upload for small files — no full-buffer OOM risk
- [x] `_metadata.json` sidecar per book folder: `generateBookMetadata()` + `uploadMetadataSidecarToDropbox()` + `uploadMetadataSidecarToDrive()` in `syncEngine.ts`; Admin → Sync tab has "Generate Sidecars" button with target/scope controls
- [x] Google Drive sync as secondary option: `getOrCreateDriveFolder()` + `uploadToDrive()` (resumable upload API) in `syncEngine.ts`; `getDriveAccessToken()` uses gws CLI in sandbox, falls back to `GOOGLE_DRIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN` env var in production; Admin Sync tab shows Drive connection status
- [x] Vitest tests for sync engine: `server/syncEngine.test.ts` (31 tests) covering slugify, generateBookMetadata, openS3Stream, fetchS3Buffer, dropboxSimpleUpload, uploadMetadataSidecarToDropbox, getOrCreateDriveFolder, uploadMetadataSidecarToDrive, uploadToDropbox routing

---

## Code Quality / Refactoring

- [x] `BookFilterBar` extracted from `Home.tsx` (possession, format, enrichment chip rows)
- [x] `useLibraryCrud` hook for CRUD dialog orchestration
- [x] Split `bookProfiles.router.ts` — extracted book CRUD (createBook, updateBook, deleteBook) into `bookCrud.router.ts` (52L); bookProfiles.router.ts now 203L
- [x] Split `Home.tsx` further — extracted `AuthorsTabContent` and `BooksTabContent` (969L → 734L); recently-enriched/tagged strips moved into AuthorsTabContent; books grid + audiobooks moved into BooksTabContent
- [x] Updated `claude.md` and `manus.md` dependency contracts table with all new components, router splits, and line counts; manus.md synced as copy of claude.md
- [x] Commit and push all changes to GitHub (pushed directly via gh CLI — all 15 checkpoints, latest: 4a3f131)

---

- [x] tRPC + Drizzle + MySQL schema
- [x] Manus OAuth authentication
