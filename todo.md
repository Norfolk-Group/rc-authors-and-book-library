- [x] FIX category label clipping: replaced Flowbite Badge 'Bio ready' (text, ~70px wide) with a small green dot indicator (w-2 h-2 rounded-full bg-chart-5), freeing ~60px for the category label
- [x] FIX missing avatars for split authors: expanded dbPhotoMap in Home.tsx to add individual name keys from combined-name entries (e.g. 'aaron ross' from 'Aaron Ross and Jason Lemkin'); also updated getAuthorPhoto() to do partial match against combined-name keys
- [x] Fixed avatar container size mismatch (h-9 w-9 → h-10 w-10) to match AvatarUpload size=40

- [x] Check for console.log/console.error statements that should be removed or replaced with structured logging (all 47 are structured operational logs with [module] prefixes — intentional)
- [x] Verify all TypeScript strict-mode compliance (no any types, no ts-ignore) (0 @ts-ignore, 6 legitimate any casts in storage/shadcn/ui)
- [x] Audit package.json for unused dependencies and remove them (removed: @aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner, echarts, date-fns)

- [x] Verify all SDK versions are current and not deprecated (all within stable semver ranges; major version jumps intentionally held back)
- [x] Audit environment variable usage: ensure all referenced env vars are documented and set (added APIFY_API_TOKEN, GEMINI_API_KEY, REPLICATE_API_TOKEN, TAVILY_API_KEY to ENV object in server/_core/env.ts)
- [x] Check for hardcoded URLs, API keys, or secrets in source code (0 hardcoded secrets found; all via process.env)
- [x] Verify tRPC router input/output schemas are complete and consistent (Zod validation) (all input procedures validated; no-arg procedures correct)
- [x] Audit S3 storage usage: check for orphaned files, verify key naming conventions (key naming consistent: author-avatars/, book-covers/; S3 list not accessible but DB tracks all keys)

### Skills Audit
- [x] List all skills in /home/ubuntu/skills/ and verify each has a valid SKILL.md (18/18 skills have valid SKILL.md)
- [x] Verify skills reference current file paths and architecture (not stale) (library-content-enrichment had stale authorPhotos/ paths — fixed)
- [x] Remove or update skills that reference deleted or renamed files (updated library-content-enrichment; no skills reference deleted files)
- [x] Ensure llm-recommendation-engine skill matches current implementation (all 5 key file paths verified; catalogue and architecture match current code)

- [x] Identify static assets stored in project directory — no binary assets in git (verified clean)
- [x] Check libraryData.ts (1218 lines) and audioData.ts (288 lines) for size optimization opportunities (data files are pure static data; splitting would add complexity without benefit; acceptable as-is)
- [x] Audit authorAvatars.ts and authorAliases.ts for stale entries (removed 6 group-shot avatar entries: Aaron Ross, Bob Burg, Dan Heath, Roger Fisher, Ashvin Vaidyanathan, Frances Frei)
- [x] Verify no binary files or large media are committed to git (clean)

### Where We Are
Checkpoint: 74461385 | Branch: main | Tests: 171 passing (13 test files)
Live URL: https://authlib-ehsrgokn.manus.space

### What Was Completed This Session

- [x] Run tests, save checkpoint, push to GitHub (completed in subsequent sessions)

## Session March 22, 2026 — Claude Opus Avatar Architecture Review + Implementation

### Claude Opus Diagnosis
- generateAvatarsBatch is dead code (orphaned, sequential loop, redundant with generateAllMissingAvatars)
- handleGeneratePortraits does 102 sequential HTTP calls (~102 min) — should delegate to generateAllMissingAvatars (~34 min)
- DB-write logic duplicated in 3 procedures
- Tavily photo ranking biases toward recency instead of authoritative sources

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] CRITICAL: Delete generateAvatarsBatch procedure (dead code, orphaned) — removed 105 lines
- [x] CRITICAL: Replace handleGeneratePortraits sequential loop with single generateAllMissingAvatars call — ~102 min → ~34 min
- [x] HIGH: Extract persistAvatarResult() shared helper to server/lib/authorAvatars/persistResult.ts
- [x] HIGH: Refactor generateAllMissingAvatars and generateAvatar to use persistAvatarResult
- [x] MEDIUM: Add reference photo quality validation in meticulousPipeline.ts (reject <10KB thumbnails, >3MB oversized)
- [x] MEDIUM: Improve Tavily photo ranking — Wikipedia+15, LinkedIn+12, publisher+10, TED+10; book covers-12, group/event-8
- [x] LOW: Add per-author loading state in author card UI during individual regeneration (already implemented)
- [x] Run 171 tests — all passing (13 test files)
- [x] Save checkpoint (7d266104), pushed to GitHub

## Comprehensive Audit & Optimization Sprint (March 25 2026)

### Phase 1: Codebase Audit
- [x] TypeScript compilation check — clean, zero errors
- [x] Find and remove dead code, unused imports, stale exports — clean
- [x] Identify oversized files (>500 lines) — Admin.tsx 1493, libraryData.ts 1245 (generated), llm.router.ts 1006 (registry data), DependenciesTab.tsx 986 (config data). All are data-heavy; splitting would not improve readability.
- [x] Resolve all TODO/FIXME/HACK comments — only 1 benign XXX in wikipedia.ts (pixel size comment)
- [x] Check for hardcoded values — all API URLs use env vars or are public endpoints; no secrets hardcoded

### Phase 2: Database Audit
- [x] Check for orphaned records — zero orphans found
- [x] Check for duplicate entries — zero duplicates (unique constraints on authorName and bookTitle)
- [x] Review schema indexes — proper indexes on authorName (unique + idx), bookTitle (unique), enrichedAt, avatarSource, authorName on book_profiles
- [x] Verify all foreign key relationships — book_profiles.authorName matches author_profiles.authorName for all rows
- [x] Check for null/empty required fields — zero empty authorName or bookTitle values

### Phase 3: Google Drive File Schema Audit
- [x] Review folder structure and naming conventions — mapped full Knowledge Library tree
- [x] Check for orphaned or misplaced files — found 2 broken folder IDs in env.ts
- [x] Verify Drive integration code matches actual folder structure — FIXED: driveBooksAudioFolderId (was 404), driveAvatarsFolderId (was empty, now points to Author Pictures)

### Phase 4: Skills Audit
- [x] Review all SKILL.md files — 21 skills, all have SKILL.md; 4 project-created skills need updating for router split
- [x] Check skills schema consistency — .skill_versions.json tracks 17 platform skills; 4 project skills (author-avatar-terminology, avatar-background-consistency, avatar-photo-recency, llm-recommendation-engine) need file path updates
- [x] Verify skills reference correct file paths — 4 project skills have stale authorProfiles.router.ts refs; noted in claude.md for future update

### Phase 5: Dependency Contracts Audit
- [x] Verify all Manus-native dependencies — 7 native services correctly categorized in DependenciesTab
- [x] Verify all third-party dependencies — 16 optional services with correct env var names
- [x] Cross-check DependenciesTab data against actual code usage — all services in DependenciesTab are actually used in the codebase
- [x] Ensure health checks match actual service endpoints — 12 health check functions verified, Gemini fixed to 2.5-flash, RapidAPI fixed

### Phase 6: Documentation — claude.md / manus.md
- [x] Review current claude.md content (was 646 lines, stale)
- [x] Review current manus.md content (did not exist)
- [x] Make claude.md the definitive source of truth (rewritten to 776 lines, fully accurate)
- [x] Sync manus.md to match claude.md exactly (exact copy, 776 lines)

- [x] Update avatar-background-consistency SKILL.md: authorProfiles.router.ts → authorAvatar.router.ts, AiTab.tsx → BackgroundSelector.tsx
- [x] Update avatar-photo-recency SKILL.md: no authorProfiles.router.ts refs found — already clean

### Suggestion 2: Regenerate libraryData.ts from Fresh Drive Scan
- [ ] Trigger Drive rescan via tRPC library.regenerate procedure
- [ ] Verify new author/book counts in the sidebar match DB counts

### Suggestion 3: Add Context7 to Dependencies Tab
- [ ] Add Context7 card to DependenciesTab third-party section (MCP-based, no API key)
- [ ] Add Context7 health check to healthCheck.router.ts (calls checkContext7Health from context7.ts)
- [ ] Wire context7 health check key into DependenciesTab healthCheckKey field

## Feature: Substack & Medium Support (March 25, 2026)

### Content Type Support (Drive Scan)
- [x] Add "Substack" and "Medium" to CONTENT_TYPE_NORMALIZE map in library.router.ts (also Blog, Newsletter)
- [x] Add Substack and Medium icons to CONTENT_TYPE_ICONS in library.router.ts (rss, pen-line)

- [x] Run pnpm db:push to migrate schema (migration 0029_burly_peter_quill.sql applied)
- [x] Add substackUrl and mediumUrl to author enrichment procedures (authorLinks.ts + authorSocial.router.ts linkFields)
- [x] Show Substack and Medium links in author bio modal (AuthorModal.tsx, AuthorBioPanel.tsx, AuthorDetail.tsx)
- [x] Show Substack and Medium icons on author cards when URLs are available (PlatformPills.tsx + FlowbiteAuthorCard.tsx)

### Enrichment
- [x] Add Substack URL discovery to authorEnrichment.ts (Wikidata P4265 = Substack username → https://{username}.substack.com)
- [x] Add Medium URL discovery to authorEnrichment.ts (infer from website URL if it contains medium.com)
- [x] Add substackUrl and mediumUrl to batch enrichment procedures (authorProfiles.router.ts uses ...info spread; AuthorInfo interface updated)

## Session March 25, 2026 — Drive Connector & Context7
- [x] Fix AUTHORS_ROOT folder ID in env.ts (already correct: 18SjO_Cz6U7hjsSQZwSFVaAA12pL2RQaf)

- [x] All 439 tests passing, TypeScript clean

## Bug Fix: HTTP 414 Request-URI Too Large (March 25, 2026)
- [x] Root cause: `trpc.favorites.checkMany.useQuery` sent 100+ author keys and 200+ book keys as a GET query string, exceeding nginx's URI length limit
- [x] Fix: Replaced two `checkMany.useQuery` calls in `useLibraryData.ts` with a single `trpc.favorites.list.useQuery` (returns all user favorites, small result set), then built author/book maps client-side from that data
- [x] Also changed `checkMany` procedure from `.query()` to `.mutation()` and raised key limit to 500 as a safety net
- [x] All 439 tests passing, TypeScript clean

## Session March 25, 2026 — Three Improvements
- [x] Wire stat tiles (AUTHORS, BOOKS, AUDIOBOOKS, CATEGORIES) to live DB counts instead of static libraryData.ts values
