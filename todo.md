# Authors & Books Library — Project TODO

Last cleaned: Apr 19, 2026

---

## Branding

- [ ] Set VITE_APP_LOGO in Management UI → Settings → General (manual step — paste CDN URL: https://d2xsxph8kpxj0f.cloudfront.net/310519663270229297/ehSrGoKN2NYhXg8UYLtWGw/Logo04256x256_4ba6138d.png)

---

## Neon Vector — Pending Pipelines

- [ ] Enable `neon-index-content-items` pipeline in Admin → Intelligence → Schedules (157 content items at 0% coverage)
- [ ] Enable `neon-index-rag-files` pipeline in Admin → Intelligence → Schedules (187 RAG files at 0% coverage)
- [ ] Populate Neon vector index: run Admin Console → Magazine Feeds → "Sync All Feeds" then "Index All in Neon"

---

## Substack Post Counts

- [ ] Enrich Substack post counts: run Admin Console → Author Enrichment → "Enrich All Social Stats"
  - This will populate actual post counts for the 40 authors with substackUrl
  - Makes the orange Substack badge show "42 posts" instead of just "Substack"

---

## S3 CDN Migration & Image Performance

- [ ] Audit all avatar URLs — identify non-S3 sources (Wikipedia, Tavily, Replicate)
- [ ] Re-upload all non-S3 avatars to S3 CDN and update author_profiles.avatar_url
- [ ] Audit all book cover URLs — identify non-S3 sources
- [ ] Re-upload all non-S3 book covers to S3 CDN and update book_profiles.s3_cover_url
- [ ] Verify 100% of avatars and covers are on S3 CDN after migration

---

## Cleanup — Optional

- [ ] Delete `client/src/lib/authorAliases.ts` (superseded by DB; still imported in 10+ places — refactor callers first)
- [ ] Delete `client/src/lib/authorAvatars.ts` (superseded by DB; still imported in 10+ places — refactor callers first)
- [ ] Add orchestrator first-run guidance card (shows when no jobs have run yet)
- [ ] Add infotips to all Admin tab content: buttons, stat cards, configuration fields

---

## Semantic Interest Heatmap

- [ ] Semantic Interest Heatmap: cluster authors/books by vector similarity with UMAP (P3 — deferred)

---

## Enrichment Orchestrator Run (Manual Steps)

- [ ] Trigger all enrichment pipelines via orchestrator runAllPipelines
- [ ] Verify Neon vector index populated (authors, books, articles namespaces)
- [ ] Verify Substack post counts updated on author badges

---

## S3 Media Migration

- [ ] Audit all asset URL columns: avatarUrl, s3AvatarUrl, coverImageUrl, s3CoverUrl, pdfUrl, s3PdfUrl, fileUrl
- [ ] Build S3 migration service: fetch from current URL → re-upload to S3 → update DB column
- [ ] Migrate author avatars (avatarUrl → s3AvatarUrl)
- [ ] Migrate book covers (coverImageUrl → s3CoverUrl)
- [ ] Migrate book PDFs / files (pdfUrl → s3PdfUrl)
- [ ] Add Admin S3 Migration UI with progress tracker and per-type controls
- [ ] Ensure all future uploads (avatar, cover, PDF ingest) write directly to S3
- [ ] Verify all CDN URLs are live and update DB columns

---

## Dropbox Content Ingestion Pipeline

- [ ] Write vitest tests for ingestion pipeline (remaining gap)

---

## Author Detail Page — Substack Tab

- [ ] Use existing `substack.getPostsByAuthor` procedure (already wired)
- [ ] Show post title, date, excerpt, and "Read on Substack" link per post
- [ ] Show "No Substack feed" empty state if substackUrl is null

---

## Audit Fixes — Remaining Low-Priority Items (from Apr 18 2026 Audit)

- [ ] A1: Add Zod schemas for all JSON blob columns in authorProfiles
- [ ] P1: Fix N+1 query in contentItems.list — use JOIN instead of separate authorContentLinks query
- [ ] P2: Add DB indexes on includedInLibrary, contentType, enrichedAt columns
- [ ] S8: Sanitize error messages in storage.ts — strip response body from client-facing errors
- [ ] A4: Validate embedding values are finite numbers before Neon vector concatenation
- [ ] Q1: Standardize error handling — critical ops throw, reads return typed Result
- [ ] H1: Memoize AuthorCard grid + debounce search input 300ms
- [ ] H3: Fix CommandPalette Cmd+K to check event.defaultPrevented
- [ ] M1: Add keyboard navigation (tabIndex, onKeyDown) to author/book card grids
- [ ] M2: Set staleTime: 5min on AuthorModal + BookModal queries
- [ ] M3: Add 400ms debounce to SemanticSearchDropdown input
- [ ] M4: Add Skeleton placeholders to AuthorDetail + BookDetail loading states
- [ ] M5: Add axis labels + legend + tooltip to InterestHeatmap
- [ ] M7: Lazy-initialize CommandPalette only on first Cmd+K press
- [ ] A5: Split drizzle/schema.ts into domain files (authors, books, content, enrichment)
- [ ] L1: Remove unused imports in AuthorDetail.tsx
- [ ] L2: Replace magic strings for tab types with typed constants
- [ ] L3: Add ARIA attributes to PageLoader spinner
- [ ] L4: Replace inline accentColor styles with CSS custom properties in ReadingPathPanel
- [ ] L5: Add onError toast callbacks to all mutations in AuthorCardActions
