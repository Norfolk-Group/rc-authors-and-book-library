## Implement All 3 Optimization Suggestions (Apr 8, 2026)

### S1 — RAG Pipeline Expansion (Build RAG Files for All Authors)
- [x] Add `seedAllPending` procedure to ragPipeline.router.ts (creates pending rows for all 177 missing authors)
- [x] Add "Seed All Authors for RAG" button to DigitalMeTab.tsx (Admin → Intelligence → Digital Me)
- [x] Show count of newly seeded authors in success toast
- [x] Idempotent: skips authors already in the RAG pipeline
- [x] Write vitest tests for the new procedure

### S2 — Tag Enrichment for All Untagged Authors
- [x] Add `autoTagAll` procedure to tags.router.ts with 15-tag taxonomy, LLM-powered batch tagging
- [x] skipExisting flag: skips authors that already have tags (default: true)
- [x] Creates new tags in `tags` table if they don't exist
- [x] Add "Auto-Tag All Authors" button to AdminIntelligenceDashboard.tsx header
- [x] Write vitest tests for the new procedure

### S3 — T2-A Pinecone Metadata Filters
- [x] Add `category`, `bookCount`, `enrichedAt` fields to VectorMetadata type in pinecone.service.ts
- [x] Add `category`, `bookCount`, `enrichedAt` to IndexAuthorInput and IndexBookInput types
- [x] Update indexAuthor and indexBook in ragPipeline.service.ts to pass metadata to Pinecone
- [x] Update indexAuthorIncremental and indexBookIncremental to accept and forward metadata
- [x] Update createAuthor and updateAuthor to extract category from tagsJson and pass to indexAuthorIncremental
- [x] Write 18 vitest tests for S1/S2/S3 metadata logic (all passing)

## Session A — Admin Quick Wins (Apr 9, 2026)

- [x] seedAllPending: All 187 authors already had RAG rows — no new rows needed
- [x] RAG generation: Ran batch script (scripts/session-a-generate-rag.mts) — 175 new RAG files generated
  - 187/187 (100%) authors now have ready RAG files (was 5.3% / 10 ready)
- [x] autoTagAll: Tagged 4 remaining untagged authors via LLM (scripts/session-a-autotag.mts)
  - Kerry Leonard manually assigned [business, leadership] (no books/bio available)
  - 187/187 (100%) authors now tagged (was 9.6% / 18 tagged)
- [x] scoreAllAuthors: Ran 3 scoring passes (scripts/session-a-score-authors.mts)
  - 187/187 (100%) authors scored against 8 user interests
  - 182 succeeded, 5 had JSON parse errors (retried in final pass)
- [x] Verified: RAG 100%, Tagged 100%, Scored 100% — all targets exceeded

---

## Session B — Data Migration (Apr 9, 2026)

### B1 — authorAliases.ts to Database
- [x] Add dedicated `author_aliases` table to schema (separate table, not aliasesJson column)
- [x] Run pnpm db:push to apply migration
- [x] Write seed script (scripts/seed-author-aliases.mjs) — seeded 159 aliases
- [x] Add authorAliases tRPC router (server/routers/authorAliases.router.ts) with getMap, getAll, upsert, delete, resolveNames
- [x] Add useAuthorAliases() hook (client/src/hooks/useAuthorAliases.ts) — DB-backed with hardcoded fallback
- [x] Update all 12 client callers of canonicalName() to use useAuthorAliases() hook
- [x] Add Admin UI tab (AdminAliasesTab) under Content > Author Aliases
- [x] Write vitest tests (server/authorAliases.router.test.ts) — 9 tests all passing
- [ ] Delete authorAliases.ts after migration verified in production (optional cleanup)

### B2 — authorAvatars.ts to Database
- [x] ASSESSED: authorAvatars.ts already superseded by DB-backed avatar system
  - author_profiles table has avatarUrl, s3AvatarUrl columns
  - getAvatarMap tRPC procedure already serves DB avatars to all components
  - getAuthorAvatar() from authorAvatars.ts is only a tertiary fallback
  - No new migration needed — architecture is already correct
- [ ] Delete authorAvatars.ts after confirming all authors have DB avatars (optional cleanup)

## Bug Fix — Hook Violation (Apr 9, 2026)

- [x] Fix "Invalid hook call / Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')" on home page
  - Root cause: useAuthorAliases() was placed at module level in AuthorBioPanel.tsx (line 428)
    between two function definitions, outside any React component body
  - Fix: moved the hook call inside the AuthorBioPanel function body
  - TypeScript: 0 errors, HMR applied at 10:15:13 AM

## ESLint — rules-of-hooks (Apr 10, 2026)

- [x] Install eslint-plugin-react-hooks (+ @eslint/js, @typescript-eslint/*, globals)
- [x] Create eslint.config.js (flat config) with rules-of-hooks: error, exhaustive-deps: warn
- [x] Add pnpm lint and pnpm lint:fix scripts to package.json
- [x] Run ESLint: 0 errors, 124 warnings (all pre-existing exhaustive-deps / no-explicit-any)
  - rules-of-hooks: CLEAN across all 100+ client source files

## ESLint — Fix exhaustive-deps & no-unused-vars (Apr 10, 2026)

- [x] Fixed all 23 exhaustive-deps warnings (0 remaining)
  - Added canonicalName to useMemo/useCallback deps in 12 files
  - Added eslint-disable-next-line for intentional mount-only useEffects (AuthorModal, AuthorBioPanel, BookDetailPanel)
  - Stabilized unstable query.data expressions in GroupContrast, InterestHeatmap
  - Extracted platformLinksData type to avoid typeof reference in AuthorCompare, Leaderboard
- [x] Fixed all 101 no-unused-vars warnings (0 remaining)
  - Removed unused imports across 25+ files
  - Prefixed intentionally unused args/vars with _ convention
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors, ESLint: 0 errors, 37 warnings (all no-explicit-any — acceptable)

## Feature — Real-time Author Search Bar (Apr 12, 2026)

- [x] Inspect current search/filter implementation on the Authors page
  - Existing header search bar was small (64px mobile, 256px desktop) and easy to miss
  - filteredAuthors already computed in useLibraryData via query state
  - FlowbiteAuthorCard already had Highlight component for matched text
- [x] Add prominent inline search bar above the author card grid in AuthorsTabContent
  - Full-width, h-11, rounded-xl with search icon on left and count+clear on right
  - Transitions: bg-muted/30 → bg-background on focus, icon color primary on focus
- [x] Debounce input with 200ms delay (localInput state + debounceRef pattern)
  - localInput updates instantly for UI feedback; parent query updates after 200ms
  - External query clears (e.g. clearFilters button) sync back to localInput via useEffect
- [x] Show live match count badge (Users icon + count, primary color when active)
- [x] Show clear button (X, only visible when there is input, active:scale-95)
- [x] Show active search feedback text below bar ("Showing N authors matching 'X'")
- [x] Highlight matched text already working via existing Highlight component in FlowbiteAuthorCard
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors, ESLint: 0 new warnings

## Feature — Collapsible Activity Strips (Apr 12, 2026)

- [x] Convert "Recently Enriched" strip in AuthorsTabContent to collapsible pill toggle
  - Amber-tinted pill with Sparkles icon, count badge, ChevronDown rotation animation
  - Default collapsed so the author grid is immediately visible on tab load
- [x] Convert "Recently Tagged" strip in AuthorsTabContent to collapsible pill toggle
  - Violet-tinted pill with Tag icon, count badge, ChevronDown rotation animation
  - Default collapsed; same open/close pattern as Enriched pill
- [x] Convert "Recently Tagged" strip in BooksTabContent to collapsible pill toggle
  - Violet-tinted pill matching Authors tab style for visual consistency
  - Default collapsed; useState(false) inside BooksTabContent function body
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors, ESLint: 0 new warnings (still 37 pre-existing no-explicit-any)

## Migration — Pinecone → Neon pgvector (Apr 17, 2026)

- [x] Install @neondatabase/serverless and pg packages
- [x] Test Neon connection and enable pgvector extension (ensureIndex + getIndexStats confirmed working)
- [x] Create vector_embeddings table in Neon with pgvector HNSW index (1536 dims)
- [x] Write neonVector.service.ts replacing pinecone.service.ts (same public API)
- [x] Switch embedding model: Gemini gemini-embedding-001 (3072d) → text-embedding-004 (1536d)
- [x] Update all server routers that import from pinecone.service.ts
- [x] Update ragPipeline.service.ts to use new service
- [x] Update aiFileClassifier.service.ts to use new service
- [x] Update enrichmentOrchestrator.service.ts pipeline keys (neon-index-*)
- [x] Update smartUpload.router.ts, recommendations.router.ts, userInterests.router.ts
- [x] Update scripts/run_all_pipelines.ts and index_pinecone_batched.ts
- [x] Rename pineconeNamespace → neonNamespace in schema + DB migration (0045_pale_betty_ross.sql)
- [x] Update Admin UI labels: Pinecone Index → Neon pgvector Index
- [x] Write vitest unit tests for neonVector.service (chunkText, makeVectorId, EMBEDDING_DIMENSION)
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors
- [x] Database migration applied successfully
