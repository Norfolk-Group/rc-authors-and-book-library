- [x] FIX category label clipping: replaced Flowbite Badge 'Bio ready' (text, ~70px wide) with a small green dot indicator (w-2 h-2 rounded-full bg-chart-5), freeing ~60px for the category label
- [x] FIX missing avatars for split authors: expanded dbPhotoMap in Home.tsx to add individual name keys from combined-name entries (e.g. 'aaron ross' from 'Aaron Ross and Jason Lemkin'); also updated getAuthorPhoto() to do partial match against combined-name keys
- [x] Fixed avatar container size mismatch (h-9 w-9 → h-10 w-10) to match AvatarUpload size=40

- [x] Identify and remove duplicate logic across server routers and lib files
- [x] Audit component files for unused props, stale state, and dead JSX branches
- [x] Check for console.log/console.error statements that should be removed or replaced with structured logging (all 47 are structured operational logs with [module] prefixes — intentional)
- [x] Verify all TypeScript strict-mode compliance (no any types, no ts-ignore) (0 @ts-ignore, 6 legitimate any casts in storage/shadcn/ui)
- [x] Audit package.json for unused dependencies and remove them (removed: @aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner, echarts, date-fns)

### Database Audit
- [x] Audit DB tables for orphaned rows (author_profiles/book_profiles with no matching Drive data)
- [x] Audit DB for duplicate entries across author_profiles and book_profiles
- [x] Verify all foreign key relationships and data integrity constraints

- [x] Audit DB indexes for query performance (4 indexes added in migration 0010)

### Infrastructure & SDK Contracts
- [x] Audit all external API integrations (Apify, Replicate, Tavily, Perplexity, Google Books) for error handling consistency (all integrations use try/catch with typed errors and console.error logging)
- [x] Verify all SDK versions are current and not deprecated (all within stable semver ranges; major version jumps intentionally held back)
- [x] Audit environment variable usage: ensure all referenced env vars are documented and set (added APIFY_API_TOKEN, GEMINI_API_KEY, REPLICATE_API_TOKEN, TAVILY_API_KEY to ENV object in server/_core/env.ts)
- [x] Check for hardcoded URLs, API keys, or secrets in source code (0 hardcoded secrets found; all via process.env)
- [x] Verify tRPC router input/output schemas are complete and consistent (Zod validation) (all input procedures validated; no-arg procedures correct)
- [x] Audit S3 storage usage: check for orphaned files, verify key naming conventions (key naming consistent: author-avatars/, book-covers/; S3 list not accessible but DB tracks all keys)

### Skills Audit
- [x] List all skills in /home/ubuntu/skills/ and verify each has a valid SKILL.md (18/18 skills have valid SKILL.md)
- [x] Verify skills reference current file paths and architecture (not stale) (library-content-enrichment had stale authorPhotos/ paths — fixed)
- [x] Remove or update skills that reference deleted or renamed files (updated library-content-enrichment; no skills reference deleted files)
- [x] Ensure llm-recommendation-engine skill matches current implementation (all 5 key file paths verified; catalogue and architecture match current code)

### Large Files Audit
- [x] Identify files > 500 lines: libraryData.ts (1218), Admin.tsx (879), llm.router.ts (696), AiTab.tsx (662), authorProfiles.router.ts (631), FlowbiteAuthorCard.tsx (571) — evaluated, acceptable given complexity
- [x] Identify static assets stored in project directory — no binary assets in git (verified clean)
- [x] Check libraryData.ts (1218 lines) and audioData.ts (288 lines) for size optimization opportunities (data files are pure static data; splitting would add complexity without benefit; acceptable as-is)
- [x] Audit authorAvatars.ts and authorAliases.ts for stale entries (removed 6 group-shot avatar entries: Aaron Ross, Bob Burg, Dan Heath, Roger Fisher, Ashvin Vaidyanathan, Frances Frei)
- [x] Verify no binary files or large media are committed to git (clean)

## Session March 22, 2026 — Avatar Resolution Pipeline (Claude Opus Plan)

### Types & Interfaces
- [ ] Add `AspectRatio` and `OutputFormat` types to `server/lib/authorAvatars/types.ts`
- [ ] Extend `ImageGenerationRequest` with: `aspectRatio`, `width`, `height`, `outputFormat`, `outputQuality`, `guidanceScale`, `numInferenceSteps`
- [ ] Extend `MeticulousPipelineOptions` with the same resolution fields
- [ ] Add avatar resolution fields to `AppSettings`: `avatarAspectRatio`, `avatarWidth`, `avatarHeight`, `avatarOutputFormat`, `avatarOutputQuality`, `avatarGuidanceScale`, `avatarInferenceSteps`
- [ ] Add default values for new resolution settings in `AppSettingsContext.tsx`

### Backend Image Generators
- [ ] Fix `imageGenerators/google.ts` — only pass `aspectRatio` to Imagen 3 (not Gemini image models); add `mapToImagen3AspectRatio` helper for unsupported ratio mapping
- [ ] Update `imageGenerators/replicate.ts` — accept and use all resolution params (width, height, format, quality, steps, guidanceScale); add `validateDimension` helper for 64px alignment
- [ ] Update `meticulousPipeline.ts` — pass resolution options through to generators (remove hardcoded `aspectRatio: "1:1"` and `guidanceScale: 7.5`)

### API Routes
- [ ] Update avatar regeneration tRPC procedure to read resolution params from input and fall back to AppSettings defaults
- [ ] Add server-side validation for resolution params (dimension range, format enum, quality range)

### Admin Console UI — Avatar Generation Sub-Tab
- [ ] Create `components/admin/AspectRatioSelector.tsx` with visual ratio labels and descriptions
- [ ] Create `components/admin/QualitySlider.tsx` with live value display
- [ ] Create `components/admin/DimensionInput.tsx` with 64px step validation
- [ ] Reorganize Avatar Generation sub-tab into 3 sections: Model Selection, Image Size & Format, Generation Parameters
- [ ] Add conditional visibility: Replicate-only controls hidden when vendor=google; aspectRatio hidden for Gemini image models
- [ ] Add vendor capability info alert (Gemini = no resolution control; Imagen 3 = aspectRatio only; Replicate = full control)
- [ ] Add "Reset to Defaults" button for resolution settings
- [ ] Update Test Portrait button to pass current resolution settings to the pipeline

## Session March 22, 2026 — Suggested Next Steps (Queued for Execution)

### 1. Wire per-card Update Links action end-to-end
- [ ] After `updateAuthorLinks` mutation completes on a card, auto-refresh the Author Bio Modal's Links section without requiring the user to close and reopen
- [ ] Invalidate `authorProfiles.get` query for the specific author after mutation settles
- [ ] Show the new links immediately in the open modal if it is already visible

### 2. Add progress indicator to per-card actions
- [ ] Show a small spinner overlay on the card while any card-level mutation (Generate Avatar, Update Bio, Update Links) is in-flight
- [ ] Disable the action menu button while a mutation is running to prevent double-submission
- [ ] Show a brief success toast with the action name when mutation completes

### 3. Expose authorDescriptionJson in Author Bio Panel
- [ ] Add a collapsible "View Research Description" panel at the bottom of the Author Bio Modal
- [ ] Parse and display the cached `authorDescriptionJson` in a readable key-value format (appearance, personality, attire, etc.)
- [ ] Add a "Refresh Description" button inside the panel that triggers Stage 1–2 of the meticulous pipeline with `forceRefresh: true`
- [ ] Only show the panel when `authorDescriptionJson` is non-null in the DB row

### 4. Run meticulous pipeline on Aaron Ross
- [ ] Trigger the meticulous pipeline for Aaron Ross (real photo now set from London Speaker Bureau)
- [ ] Confirm Stage 2 vision analysis correctly identifies him from the real photo
- [ ] Verify the generated `AuthorDescription` JSON is accurate and cached in DB
- [ ] Optionally regenerate AI avatar using the corrected description

## Session March 22, 2026 — Avatar Background Consistency Skill

- [ ] Add background post-processing step for real photos (remove.bg or Gemini background replacement)
- [ ] Add background consistency controls to Admin Console → AI tab → Avatar Generation sub-tab
- [ ] Add batch "Normalize Avatar Backgrounds" action to Admin Console → Authors tab
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with the canonical background spec

### Session March 22, 2026 — Execute Suggested Next Steps
- [x] Implement Background Selector UI in Admin Console AI tab (visual swatches + hex picker)
- [x] Add auditAvatarBackgrounds tRPC procedure using Gemini Vision batch check
- [x] Add Normalize All batch action to Admin Console Authors tab
- [x] Wire updateAuthorLinks per-card mutation to auto-refresh Author Bio Modal on settle
