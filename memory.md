- **Jolt Effect duplicate**: Deleted `book_profiles` id=98 ("The Jolt Effect" by Matt Dixon only); kept id=30005 ("The JOLT Effect" by Matthew Dixon & Ted McKenna — more complete attribution). Same ISBN confirmed true duplicate.
- Checkpoint: `268a8543`

### All Book Enrichment Todo Items Confirmed Complete
- Verified all 9 enrichment items were already implemented in prior sessions; marked as done in todo.md.
- Pushed to GitHub (`bcc9743`).
- Checkpoint: `38d67217`

### Comprehensive Documentation

- Created this `memory.md` file.

### Back to Top Button (Completed)
- Created `client/src/components/BackToTop.tsx`: Framer Motion spring animation, appears after 300px scroll, 3D shadow button style, smooth scroll-to-top on click.
- Added `mainRef = useRef<HTMLElement>(null)` to `Home.tsx` and attached to `<main ref={mainRef}>`.
- Rendered `<BackToTop scrollContainerRef={mainRef} />` at the bottom of the component tree.
- 122 tests passing.

### Standing Rules Established

- Created `memory.md` (this file) with full reconstructed session history.
- Updated `claude.md` last-updated date and added `BackToTop` to component table and tree.

### Avatar Sizes Tripled & 3D Tilt Removed

All author avatar sizes tripled across every card component:
- `FlowbiteAuthorCard`: `h-9 w-9` (36px) → `h-28 w-28` (112px), column-centered layout
- `AuthorCard` (Home.tsx): `w-10 h-10` (40px) → `w-[120px] h-[120px]`, column-centered layout
- `AuthorAccordionRow`: `h-7 w-7` (28px) → `h-[84px] w-[84px]`

The `useCardTilt` 3D tilt hook (using `useMotionValue`, `useSpring`, `useTransform`) was removed from all 4 card components. Replaced with Framer Motion `whileHover={{ scale: 1.04 }} whileTap={{ scale: 0.97 }}` spring animation on card wrappers. Avatar images use CSS `hover:scale-110 active:scale-95`.

Three.js integration added to todo list (use case TBD by user).

Files changed: `FlowbiteAuthorCard.tsx`, `AuthorAccordionRow.tsx`, `Home.tsx`, `claude.md`, `memory.md`, `todo.md`
122 tests passing.

### File Re-Architecture & Codebase Optimization (Context-Compacted Session)

The session inherited from a prior context that exceeded limits. The following work was completed in the previous context and is being documented here:

Fixed unicode box-drawing characters (U+2500 family, em-dashes, curly quotes) in 52 files project-wide. These were causing a Vite parse error at Home.tsx line 279.

Split Home.tsx from 1908 lines to 687 lines by extracting 6 components into client/src/components/library/: AuthorCard.tsx, BookCard.tsx, AudioCard.tsx, AuthorBioPanel.tsx, BookDetailPanel.tsx, LibraryPrimitives.tsx, and libraryConstants.ts.

Split Admin.tsx from 1187 lines to 857 lines by extracting 3 tab components into client/src/components/admin/: CascadeTab.tsx, SettingsTab.tsx, AboutTab.tsx, ActionCard.tsx, adminTypes.ts.

Extracted server helpers: enrichAuthorViaWikipedia() + generateBioWithLLM() into server/lib/authorEnrichment.ts (authorProfiles.router.ts: 672 -> 532 lines). Extracted enrichBookViaGoogleBooks() + generateBookSummaryWithLLM() into server/lib/bookEnrichment.ts (bookProfiles.router.ts: 515 -> 313 lines).

Deleted 4 legacy dead-code router files totalling 1590 lines.

All 122 tests still passing. claude.md architecture overview updated with new file structure. Checkpoint: 6ef6c867.

## Session March 21, 2026 — One-Author-Per-Card + Avatar Background Color

### One-Author-Per-Card Rule (Item 1)
- **authorAliases.ts**: All combined-name entries (e.g. "Aaron Ross and Jason Lemkin") now resolve to the first author's canonical name. Added individual canonical entries for 14 co-authors: Jason Lemkin, Bill Carr, Anne Morriss, Bo Burlingham, Ruben Rabago, Ted McKenna, Brent Adamson, Nick Toman, Rick DeLisi, William Ury, Chip Heath, John David Mann, Kelly Leonard, Tom Yorton.
- **authorAvatars.ts**: Removed all combined-name photo entries (group shots). Each primary co-author now has their own individual entry pointing to the same CDN URL. Secondary co-authors (Jason Lemkin, William Ury, Chip Heath, etc.) will use the DB waterfall for individual portraits.
- **DB author_profiles**: Added individual rows for 11 co-authors who had no DB row.
- **DB book_profiles**: Split multi-author book rows — each co-author now has their own book_profiles row with the same cover/metadata.

### Avatar Background Color (Item 2)
- **AppSettingsContext.tsx**: Added `avatarBgColor: string` to `AppSettings` type (default `#1e293b`). Persisted to localStorage via existing `app-settings-v2` key.
- **SettingsTab.tsx**: Added "Avatar Background Color" card with 9 preset swatches (Slate, Navy, Charcoal, Forest, Ocean, Plum, Warm Grey, Cream, White) + native `<input type="color">` picker + live hex preview.
- **replicateGeneration.ts**: Added `describeColor(hex)` helper that converts hex to human-readable color name. Updated `buildPrompt(authorName, bgColor?)` to inject the color description into the portrait prompt (e.g. "solid deep navy blue background"). Updated `generateAIPortrait(authorName, bgColor?)` signature.
- **authorProfiles.router.ts**: Updated `generatePortrait` procedure input schema to accept optional `bgColor` string, passed through to `generateAIPortrait`.
- **AuthorBioPanel.tsx**: Reads `settings.avatarBgColor` from `useAppSettings()` and passes it to the generate portrait button's mutation call.
- **Admin.tsx**: Batch portrait generation passes `settings.avatarBgColor` to each `generatePortrait` mutation.

### Test Results
- 122 tests passing (9 test files), 0 TypeScript errors.
